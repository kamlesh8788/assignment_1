    "1. Difference between a Function and a Method in Python\n",
    "A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.\n",
    "It can exist independently of any class or object.\n",
    "On the other hand, a method is also a function but it is associated with an object or class.\n",
    "Methods are defined inside classes and can access or modify the data of the object on which they are called.\n",
    "In short, functions are general-purpose code blocks, while methods are functions tied to class instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Concept of Function Arguments and Parameters\n",
    "Parameters are variables listed in the function definition.\n",
    "They act as placeholders for values that will be provided when the function is called.\n",
    "Arguments are the actual values or data passed to those parameters when calling the function.\n",
    "When a function executes, arguments replace the parameters, allowing the function to perform operations using real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Different Ways to Define and Call a Function\n",
    "Functions in Python can be defined in two primary ways:\n",
    "(a) Using the 'def' keyword to create a standard function.\n",
    "(b) Using the 'lambda' keyword to define an anonymous one-line function.\n",
    "Once defined, functions can be called by their name followed by parentheses containing arguments.\n",
    "Functions can also be called recursively, meaning a function can call itself to solve smaller subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Purpose of the 'return' Statement\n",
    "The 'return' statement in Python is used to send a value or result back to the place where the function was called.\n",
    "It ends the function’s execution immediately.\n",
    "If no return statement is provided, the function automatically returns 'None'.\n",
    "The main purpose of 'return' is to pass data from the function to the main program or another function for further use.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Iterators in Python and Difference from Iterables\n",
    "An iterable is any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time, such as lists, tuples, or strings.\n",
    "It implements the '__iter__()' method that returns an iterator.\n",
    "An iterator, on the other hand, is an object that keeps track of its current position and produces elements one by one using the 'next()' function.\n",
    "The difference is that iterables can be looped over multiple times, while iterators are consumed as you iterate through them.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Concept of Generators and How They Are Defined\n",
    "Generators are special types of iterators that generate values on the fly instead of storing them in memory.\n",
    "They are defined like normal functions but use the 'yield' keyword instead of 'return'.\n",
    "When a generator function is called, it doesn’t execute immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object.\n",
    "The code inside the generator runs each time 'next()' is called, resuming from the last 'yield' point.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Advantages of Generators over Regular Functions\n",
    "1. Generators save memory because they don’t store all values in memory at once; they generate data as needed.\n",
    "2. They improve performance when handling large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
    "3. They preserve the function’s state between calls using 'yield', making them efficient for iterative data processing.\n",
    "4. They are simpler and cleaner to write compared to using iterator classes manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Lambda Function and When It Is Used\n",
    "A lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined without a name using the 'lambda' keyword.\n",
    "It can take multiple arguments but can only contain a single expression.\n",
    "Lambda functions are typically used for short, simple operations that are used temporarily.\n",
    "They are often passed as arguments to functions like map(), filter(), and sorted().\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Purpose and Usage of map() Function\n",
    "The 'map()' function in Python is used to apply a specific operation to each element of an iterable.\n",
    "It takes two arguments: a function and an iterable.\n",
    "It returns an iterator that produces the results one by one instead of creating a list directly.\n",
    "The main purpose of 'map()' is to perform transformations or calculations on a sequence of data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Difference Between map(), reduce(), and filter() Functions\n",
    "map(): Used to apply a function to every element in an iterable and return a new iterator containing the modified values.\n",
    "filter(): Used to select elements from an iterable that satisfy a specific condition or rule, returning only the matching elements.\n",
    "reduce(): Used to apply a function cumulatively to elements of an iterable, reducing the entire sequence to a single result (like sum or product).\n",
    "Together, these functions support functional programming in Python, allowing concise and readable data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Internal Mechanism of reduce() on [47, 11, 42, 13"
