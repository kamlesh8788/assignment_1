    "# 1️ What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that organizes code into objects that contain both data (attributes) and functions (methods).\n",
    "# It helps to make code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
    "# The four main principles of OOP are Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2️ What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "# A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.\n",
    "# It defines the attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior and state of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3️ What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "# An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "# It represents a real-world entity that has specific properties and behaviors.\n",
    "# Objects are used to access the data and methods defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4️ What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction means hiding unnecessary details and showing only important information to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods together into a single unit and restricting direct access to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction focuses on hiding complexity, while encapsulation focuses on protecting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5️ What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dunder methods (Double UNDERscore methods) are special predefined methods in Python that start and end with double underscores like __init__, __str__, etc.\n",
    "# They are used to give special behavior to classes such as object creation, representation, or operator overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6️ Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inheritance is a concept where one class (child class) can acquire the properties and methods of another class (parent class).\n",
    "# It promotes code reusability and helps to create a class hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7️ What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism means “many forms.”\n",
    "# It allows the same function or method name to behave differently depending on the object that calls it.\n",
    "# It makes code more flexible and extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8️ How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation is achieved using private variables and methods by prefixing them with double underscores (__).\n",
    "# This hides the data from direct modification and ensures controlled access through getter and setter methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9️ What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "# A constructor is a special method named __init__() in Python that is automatically called when an object is created.\n",
    "# It is used to initialize the object’s attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class methods use the @classmethod decorator and work with class variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Static methods use the @staticmethod decorator and do not depend on the class or instance; they act like normal utility functions inside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11️. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method overloading is when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters.\n",
    "# Python doesn’t support true overloading, but similar behavior can be achieved using default or variable-length arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12️. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method overriding happens when a child class defines a method with the same name as in its parent class.\n",
    "# The child’s version replaces the parent’s version when called.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 13️ What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "# A property decorator (@property) is used to make a method act like an attribute.\n",
    "# It allows you to access a method’s return value using dot notation, without calling it like a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 14️ Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism is important because it allows one interface to be used for different types of objects.\n",
    "# It makes code more reusable, scalable, and easier to maintain, as the same function can work with different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 15️ What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "# An abstract class is a blueprint for other classes.\n",
    "# It cannot be instantiated directly and usually contains one or more abstract methods that must be implemented in child classes.\n",
    "# It is defined using the abc module.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 16️ What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "# * Promotes code reusability through inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# * Provides data security using encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# * Increases modularity and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# * Easier to maintain and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "# * Models real-world entities effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 17️ What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class variable is shared by all objects of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instance variable is unique to each object.\n",
    "# Class variables define common properties, while instance variables define individual properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 18️ What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit features from more than one parent class.\n",
    "# It allows a child class to combine the behavior of multiple base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 19️ Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# __str__() defines how an object is displayed to the user (human-readable).\n",
    "\n",
    "# __repr__() defines how an object is represented internally (developer-readable).\n",
    "# Both are used for object representation and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 20️ What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The super() function is used to call methods of the parent class inside the child class.\n",
    "# It helps in reusing the parent’s functionality without explicitly naming the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 21️ What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The __del__() method is known as a destructor.\n",
    "# It is automatically called when an object is deleted or goes out of scope.\n",
    "# It is used for cleanup operations such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 22️ What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
    "# Feature\t@staticmethod\t@classmethod\n",
    "# Parameter\tNo default parameter\tTakes cls as first parameter\n",
    "# Access class data\tNo\tYes\n",
    "# Use case\tUtility functions\tModify or access class-level data\n",
    "\n",
    "# 23️ How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism in Python works through method overriding.\n",
    "# When a subclass defines a method with the same name as the superclass, Python automatically decides which one to execute based on the object type at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 24️ What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called in a single line on the same object.\n",
    "# It works by returning the object (self) from each method, allowing continuous calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 25️ What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The __call__() method allows an object to be called like a function.\n",
    "# When defined in a class, calling the object executes the code inside the __call__ method"
