    "# Q1) Difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
    "# Interpreted languages execute the program line by line using an interpreter. This makes them easy to test,\n",
    "# debug, and run on different systems without a special compilation step. However, they are usually slower.\n",
    "# Compiled languages convert the entire code into machine code before running, which improves performance and\n",
    "# catches some errors early. Python is mostly interpreted, though it internally compiles code to bytecode first.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2) What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "# Exception handling is a system that lets a program deal with unexpected errors during runtime. Instead of\n",
    "# stopping the entire program, Python lets us catch the error using try and except blocks, allowing the program\n",
    "# to continue or fail safely with a proper message.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3) Purpose of the finally block\n",
    "# The finally block is used when you want some code to run no matter what happens in the try block—whether an\n",
    "# error occurs or not. It is commonly used for cleanup tasks such as closing files, stopping timers, or\n",
    "# releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4) What is logging in Python?\n",
    "# Logging allows the program to keep a record of important events, errors, or general information. It helps in\n",
    "# understanding how a program behaves, tracking bugs, and monitoring systems. The logging module lets you store\n",
    "# logs in files or show them on the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5) Significance of __del__ method\n",
    "# The __del__() method is a destructor that gets called when an object is about to be removed from memory.\n",
    "# It can be used to perform small cleanup actions. However, Python does not guarantee exactly when this method\n",
    "# will run, so it should not be used for important cleanup operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6) Difference between import and from ... import\n",
    "# 'import module' loads the entire module into memory, and you access functions with module.name.\n",
    "# 'from module import name' loads only the specific function or class, making the code shorter.\n",
    "# Using 'from module import *' is not recommended because it can cause name conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7) Handling multiple exceptions\n",
    "# Python allows handling multiple exceptions by writing separate except blocks. You can also group exceptions\n",
    "# using a tuple, which makes it easier to catch several related errors together.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q8) Purpose of with statement in file handling\n",
    "# The with statement is used to handle files safely. It opens the file, and once the block is finished, it\n",
    "# closes the file automatically—even if the program hits an error. This prevents resource leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q9) Multithreading vs multiprocessing\n",
    "# Multithreading uses multiple threads inside a single process. It is suitable for tasks that wait for I/O\n",
    "# operations like downloading or reading files. However, due to Python's GIL, threads are not very effective\n",
    "# for CPU-heavy work.\n",
    "# Multiprocessing creates multiple processes, each with its own memory. This is better for CPU-heavy tasks,\n",
    "# as each process can fully utilize the CPU without GIL limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q10) Advantages of logging\n",
    "# Logging helps keep a history of what the program is doing. It is useful for debugging, tracking issues,\n",
    "# analyzing performance, and monitoring long-running applications. Logs can be saved to files for later review.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q11) Memory management in Python\n",
    "# Python automatically handles memory through reference counting and garbage collection. Objects that are no\n",
    "# longer needed are cleaned up by the interpreter. Python also manages a private heap space where all objects\n",
    "# are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q12) Basic steps of exception handling\n",
    "# - Place risky code inside a try block.\n",
    "# - Catch errors using one or more except blocks.\n",
    "# - Use the else block for code that should run only if no error happens.\n",
    "# - Use the finally block for cleanup actions that must happen regardless of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q13) Importance of memory management\n",
    "# Without proper memory management, a program can slow down, crash, or run out of memory. Python’s automatic\n",
    "# memory handling helps avoid such issues, but developers must still avoid unnecessary data storage and\n",
    "# circular references.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q14) Role of try and except\n",
    "# The try block contains code that might raise an error. The except block catches and handles the error,\n",
    "# preventing the program from crashing and allowing graceful recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q15) How Python's garbage collection works\n",
    "# Python uses reference counting to track how many references point to an object. When the count becomes zero,\n",
    "# the object is deleted. For circular references, Python uses a garbage collector that runs periodically to\n",
    "# find and clean them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q16) Purpose of else block\n",
    "# The else block runs when no exception is raised in the try block. It is useful for separating \"successful\n",
    "# code\" from the code meant for error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q17) Common logging levels\n",
    "# Python supports five main logging levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. These levels help\n",
    "# organize logs based on importance or severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q18) Difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing\n",
    "# os.fork() creates a copy of the current process but works only on Unix-like systems. It is low-level.\n",
    "# The multiprocessing module provides a higher-level, platform-independent way to create processes, making\n",
    "# it easier and safer to work with parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q19) Importance of closing a file\n",
    "# Closing a file ensures that all data is saved properly and frees up system resources. If a file is not closed,\n",
    "# it may lead to data corruption or memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q20) file.read() vs file.readline()\n",
    "# file.read() reads the entire file content at once and returns it as a single string.\n",
    "# file.readline() reads only the next single line, making it useful for reading files one line at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q21) Purpose of logging module\n",
    "# The logging module provides tools to create logs, format messages, set log levels, and route logs to files,\n",
    "# consoles, or other places. It helps manage logs in a clean and structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q22) Purpose of os module in file handling\n",
    "# The os module helps interact with the operating system. It allows checking if a file exists, deleting files,\n",
    "# creating directories, joining paths, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q23) Challenges of memory management\n",
    "# Memory leaks, circular references, keeping large unused objects, and poor cleanup practices can all cause\n",
    "# memory issues. Monitoring memory usage in long-running applications is especially important.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q24) How to raise an exception manually\n",
    "# In Python, you can raise an exception using the raise keyword, for example:\n",
    "# raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q25) Why multithreading is important\n",
    "# Multithreading is helpful when a program needs to handle multiple tasks that spend time waiting—such as\n",
    "# downloading files, handling user input, or reading databases. It keeps programs responsive and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q1) How can you open a file for writing in Python and write a string to it?\n",
